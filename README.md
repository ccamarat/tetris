# Tetris Clone
Back in 2008 I wanted to try my hand at creating a video game. I like Tetris so it seemed like as good a starting point as any.
Took a weekend and got the major functionality in there, and then spent another three weeks off-and-on "polishing" it before 
I got sidetracked by real life. It looks like I did another update in ~2011; neither attempt utilized a build process, so
everything was just jammed into "engine.js".
